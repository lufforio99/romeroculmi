        <em>About This Place:</em><br>
        Libraries in UPD, especially CS Lib, were where my friends
        and I spent most of our time studying and chatting.
        We don't get to go out much so our bonding is mostly
        through studying. The libraries are nice and cozy.

        <em>Fun Fact:</em><br>
        I love cats and I have many pictures of UP cats on my phone.
        The CS Lib cat was the first cat I've ever taken a picture of
        because I needed to withdraw money and he was lying right in
        front of the ATM. He wouldn't move! Sadly he's dead now.<br>

        <em>Do I Recommend:</em><br>
        Yes. It's a good place to study, relax and hang out with friends
        as long as you keep quiet. It's also safe enough to leave your
        belongings on the tables. And some libraries allow food in certain
        areas.

        <em>Favorite Memory:</em><br>
        I was cramming for a requirement and my friends
        accompanied me even if it began to get late out.
        Some of them have to travel far but they wanted
        to be with us. So I bought them snacks.

        <em>Worst Memory:</em><br>
        We were studying for a math exam and I wasn't
         understanding anything anymore. I felt very lost.
        My score for that exam was around 50%. Yum!
