      <em>About This Place:</em><br>
      Before the pandemic, I used to spend
      most of the week at the dorm. I take the jeep to
      school. On weekends I go home by the bus, riding
      through EDSA. The journey takes 2 to 3 hours.
      The bus drops me off in the middle of the street.
      I have to run and climb over a gate without getting caught
      by traffic enforcers.

      <em>Fun Fact:</em><br>
      I made a friend on the bus. We don't talk but we always
      let the other know if our bus is coming and we sit next
      to each other. He studies at Ateneo. I hope he's doing well.<br><br>

      <em>Do I Recommend:</em><br>
      No. Everyone knows commuting here is awful.
      But I kinda miss the thrill. Almost getting run over
      by motorcycles make me feel so alive. I got so good
      at jumping off of moving vehicles because jeep
      drivers wouldn't stop for me.

      <em>Favorite Memory:</em><br>
      It was nearly 10 pm at MRT. My friend and I were on our way 
      home from a party. The train stopped so we called our friends
      waiting for us at the dorm. We missed each other even if
      we've only been apart for half the day.

      <em>Worst Memory:</em><br>
      I fell down in the space between the platform
      and the train once. It was at LRT and my friend
      saved me. When we boarded the train everyone was
      talking about me. But they didn't help me!
